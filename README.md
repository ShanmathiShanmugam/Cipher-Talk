## CipherTalk
The integration of secure messaging methods, such as encryption and steganography, within a chat platform to enhance privacy and security during online communication.

## About
CipherTalk is a secure chat platform designed to provide users with a comprehensive solution for private conversations. By integrating advanced encryption techniques and image steganography, CipherTalk allows users to send messages securely, either through encrypted text or by hiding messages within images. Traditional messaging platforms often fall short in providing layered security, leaving sensitive conversations vulnerable. This project overcomes those challenges by combining multiple security technologies, giving users control over their communication privacy. With an easy-to-use interface, CipherTalk offers a seamless way to protect confidential conversations and ensure safe exchanges in personal and professional contexts.

## Features
- Implements Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encrypting text messages.
- Image Steganography to hide messages within images.
- Secure key management for decrypting messages and images.
- Real-time communication using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
- A highly scalable framework that ensures smooth performance.
- User authentication with encrypted login credentials.
- JSON data format for structured message handling.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or later, Ubuntu 20.04+) to ensure compatibility with encryption libraries.
* Development Environment: Node.js (v14 or later) for the backend, and Express.js for server-side operations.
* Database: MongoDB for storing user information and chat logs securely.
* Encryption Libraries: Crypto.js or similar for AES encryption.
* Steganography Libraries: Python libraries such as Stegano or custom JavaScript libraries for encoding and decoding images.
* WebSocket Communication: Socket.IO for real-time messaging.
* IDE: Visual Studio Code or any other suitable IDE for writing, debugging, and testing the code.
* Version Control: GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
